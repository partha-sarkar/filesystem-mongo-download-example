Astria is a new type of drone that can perform up-close, touch, and robotic tasks (not just video or remote sensing). The company has also developed initial sensor payload prototypes for use on the drone platform and leverages a patented cyclorotor for precision positioning, and a patent-pending configuration to mount a 5-10lb payload on an interchangeable payload arm. This aerial platform can replace expensive rope, crane, and helicopter access inspections, which are among the most dangerous jobs in America. Leveraging interchangeable payloads, Astria will measure cracks, detect subsurface defects, install parts, repair equipment, and keep inspectors safely on the ground.",

The small, device, similar in size to a tampon, is designed for use at home, as needed when needed, based on familiar symptoms.   Development to date includes supportive work performed in vitro, ex vivo as well as in vivo (safety).  Current work in microbiology expands our understanding of microbicidal light and it's effects on key pathogens associated with yeast and bacterial indications.  Results from test data will be used to develop devices suitable for human use which will be validated in an early feasibility study focused on mechanism of action as efficacious in a human model.  Cern has been granted utility and design patents along with trademarks. Cern has also received supportive 3rd part assessment specific to Freedom to Operate.  Cern Corporation is currently in the pre-revenue and prototype/testing stages of development.",

Our engine is built to replace fossil-fired industrial steam boilers and dryers by a low-cost, fully electric alternative, in the form of high temperature heat pumps. Long-term, we plan to replace gas-fired peaker power plants, which provide backup power when there is no sun or wind, by a hybrid daily and seasonal renewable energy storage system, powered by the same engine as the heat pumps. Combined, those two market opportunities can prevent one third of worldwide direct CO2 emissions, or more than 12 Gt/year. Enough to change the fate of our climate.",

  "description": "We are ZenVR: a meditation curriculum taught in Virtual Reality. We combine the structure and teachings of real-world classes in the practice of meditation with the immersion of VR. With progressive lessons taught by your own instructor, you can learn the basics of meditation and a variety of mental and physical techniques you can use to bring balance, focus, and calm from virtual reality to your reality. ​ ZenVR began as a Master's Thesis project at The Georgia Institute of Technology. The ZenVR experience has been empirically proven to successfully guide novice meditators through their journey and affect real-world change, increasing mindfulness and equipping them with tools they can use in their daily lives. Now we're transforming our prototype into a product to distribute across VR platforms and share the benefits of meditation with the world.",

We transformed these recipes into tamales with healthier and cleaner ingredients, for vegans, vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. What began as a small restaurant in Tucson and has blossomed into a national brand . We operate 2 manufacturing facilities in Tucson, employ 65 people, sold in over 5,000 stores and sell over 15,000 packages direct to consumer. We have an 8,000 square foot manufacturing facility that supports our eComm and innovation. Our second facility is 14,000 sq. ft. and can produce 20 million tamales annually. Are tamales are sold in grocers freezers, delis and grab n go sections. Brands can check many boxes – gluten free, organic ingredients, hormone free meats and cheeses, but unless the product tastes good – what does it matter? Our tamales are hands down the best tasting tamales out there. We have NEVER lost a cutting. We have a loyal and engaged customer base nationwide. Our tamales are convenient, tasty and a Latin favorite. Authenticity matters. In keeping with the ancient traditions, we hand roll every tamale at our own facility in the traditional hoja (corn husk), and we blast freeze our tamales after cooking so there is no need for additives or preservatives. We provide promotional support at point of sale. We are the #1 Tamale Nationally in Natural.",

  "description": "LIVSN uses natural and technical materials to create sustainable, high-quality outdoor clothing with classic styling and a modern fit. Our passion is for the outdoors and our interest is in high quality clothing. We love finding good fabric and admiring the hand, the weight, and the texture. The story of the material and what it can do inspires us to create clothing as dynamic as the fabric. The name LIVSN comes from the Swedish word \"livsnjutare,\"​ which roughly translates to \"one who loves life deeply; an enjoyer of life.\"​  We know we won't regret more time outside - or with friends - or with family. Abraham Maslow's famous Hierarchy of Needs lists clothing among the physiological needs to meet before moving on towards the ultimate goal of self-actualization. If clothing is something that we must have, then we believe it should perform well, look good, be ethically made, environmentally friendly - and it should last. We design our clothing to be dynamic, made with naturally technical materials, and have a subdued style. We're not out to make the \"best\"​ shirt or the \"most advanced\"​ jacket in the world. We want to make good clothing, we want to make it with tried and true methods, and we want to make it with high quality materials and modern fits.",

Despite all the recent breakthroughs in cancer treatments, it is estimated that by 2040, the number of new registered cases and fatalities per year will increase to 30.2 M and 16.3 M, respectively [2, 3].  One of the main reasons cancer still has such a high mortality rate is due to the current lack of tests with the required sensitivity and specificity to aid in the early diagnosis of the disease. ",

Through our high-complexity CLIA lab, we offer what is believed to be the first multi-cancer screening blood test in the U.S. costing under $200. In response to the global pandemic, we expanded our CLIA laboratory test menu to include PCR testing. Due to our ability to scale our COVID testing operation, 2021 revenues exceeded $9 million with over $1 million in net profits for the year. This represents a more than 300% increase over 2020 revenues. As a result, we ranked no. 131 on the Inc. 5000 list of America’s fastest-growing companies in 2022. To grow our portfolio of tests, the Company has built a Clinical Laboratory Innovation Accelerator, or CLIAx, which we believe is the country’s first accelerator facility for diagnostics start-ups. Our CLIAx is expected to help fuel our product and revenue growth for the next five years and already has two companies signed up to join.",

  "description": "Farm to Flame Energy sells power created with our smokeless and odorless biomass-powered generators. Our generators operate at half the cost of diesel fuel, having a large impact on emerging communities internationally. These compete with existing biomass-powered generators for a few reasons. Our generators are able to use a wide range of biomass feedstocks, whereas currently available options are limited to one or two. Secondly, our patented combustion process allows us to burn all of these fuels without smoke, odor, or harmful particulates. This makes our solution safer than current options. In addition to these benefits, our generator will come with a blockchain-based application that will allow customers to remotely monitor and manage their generators, as well as any other generators in their microgrid. They will be able to remotely turn their generator on and off, be alerted when they are running low on fuel, and be alerted when their generator requires maintenance. Our customers will have peace of mind knowing that all they really need to do is load up the fuel to be provided with reliable electricity output.",

With it’s name borrowed from an old Santa Ana bar, the Blinking Owl is ready to be intricately woven into the local scene. While founder, Brian Christenson, inherited the passion for making booze from his boot-legging great-grandfather, we intend to LEGALLY carry on his family's “spirit” production by making vodka, gin, whiskies (including Bourbon) and the specialty spirit, aquavit. Our classic spirits will certainly stand out with their California-centric twist, including locally sourced ingredients from community and urban farms, aging in California wine barrels, and collaborations with local chefs and breweries. The talented husband and wife team, Brian and Robin manage and operate the Company along side a talented head distiller. Brian and Robin, through their passion for quality wine, cocktails and food, have established a network of restaurateurs, bartenders, bar owners, alcohol distributors, and alcohol industry connections. They also have over a decade of successful backgrounds as business owners and advertising/branding specialists.",

  "description": "Terpenes are naturally occurring chemical compounds, mostly found in plants, that are responsible for their distinct aroma, smell and even pigment. They are the building blocks of essential oils, and there are over 20,000 different known Terpenes. These compounds are found in herbs, fruits, roots, leaves, flowers, bark, seeds, grasses, sap, cannabis, and are even found in some animals. They are highly functional and integral to a plant’s life, and have many functions such as: attracting pollinators, repelling pests and other insects, protection, recovery, and even boosting immunity to thwart infection (just to name a few). Not only do Terpenes offer these benefits to plants, but they also have the ability to offer them to humans as well. Alternative therapies such as aromatherapy are hugely popular thanks to essential oils derived from plants, and their unique terpene compounds. Something so simple as inhaling their aroma can energize (lemons), calm and de-stress (lavender), boost mood (oranges), and so much more. There is much research on terpenes, their potential therapeutic benefits and myriad of uses.",

  "description": "Mindfulness, in various forms, has proven results in reducing stress; easing anger and anxiety; and providing the mental, emotional, spiritual and physical fortitude required to stay grounded and present in challenging and even life-threatening situations. Centuries of systemic oppression have had a considerable impact on the physical, emotional and spiritual well-being of African Americans specifically and people of African descent globally. Despite these challenges, we survive, we flourish, and we thrive, yet it is often at the expense of our own mental and physical self care and results in high amounts of stress related illness. We believe that identifying or establishing and maintaining consistent mindfulness practices can heal our minds, bodies and souls and has been proven to result in significant stress reduction.",

Popoca means “emits smoke” to the native people of El Salvador, who stoked wood fires to prepare food over a comal for their families. Revered as more than just a means of cooking, smoke represents a prayer or offering to the spirits. Inspired by traditional Salvadoran wood-fire cooking and recipes, Popoca offers dishes — like pupusas and tamales that use the freshest ingredients and fresh-milled masa — delivering an experience that helps you envision the beauty of El Salvador from the Bay Area.",

  "description": "Sen-Jam Pharmaceutical is developing a line of anti-inflammatory drugs designed to provide a much-needed update to a multi-billion dollar market that has seen little innovation in the past 30 years, or since aspirin was invented 125 years ago.  We are developing 12  different drugs targeting 7  therapeutic areas intended to reduce pain and inflammation by harnessing your body’s immune system, at the very beginning of the inflammatory cascade.  We seek to prevent acute inflammation, slow the progression of inflammatory chronic illnesses, and improve health span. According to our research, there are no  pharmaceutical products available to the consumer, either Over-the-Counter (OTC) or prescription (Rx), that acts so early, and safely, at the very beginning of inflammation. Our initial drugs are pre-market, patented, and will seek FDA-approval.  Sen-Jam is currently enrolling patients in our covid oral therapeutic Phase 2 Clinical Trial in collaboration with Duke University.  Sen-Jam is also ready to begin our Phase 2 clinical trial for prevention of alcohol’s toxic effects.  Because we repurpose small molecules with over 30 years of safety data, we are able to bring these new pharmaceuticals to the consumer rapidly, using an accelerated FDA pathway for approval.",

  "description": "Community ownership of professional clubs is common in Europe.  But in North America, pro teams are almost exclusively owned by billionaires.  Fan Owned Club changes that. This winter, Fan Owned Club will offer a limited number of minority ownership shares in FC Pinzgau Saalfelden (FCPS) to the public through our website. Nestled in the beautiful Austrian Alps, FCPS plays in the 3rd division in Austria, a well-respected association that receives five berths each year in UEFA play.  The club is led by new coach and famed German footballer Christian Ziege and boosted by a player loan deal with MLS club Real Salt Lake. The team is off to its best start in its 12-year history with a chance to earn promotion to the 2nd division this spring.  And we are assembling a crack front executive team with decades of professional playing, coaching and front office experience as well as a track record of success in the business world. Are you a soccer fan interested in getting more out of your Fandom?  Or a successful professional looking to get in on the ground floor of a unique ownership opportunity?  Join our mailing list at www.fanownedclub.com or message our team directly.",

  "description": "At Light Art VR, we celebrate movers and shakers—avant-gardes of their field. For this reason, we approached the virtual reality industry with nothing less than true innovation. We noticed a void in the VR market, and we sought out to fill it. No VR program has tapped into one of the richest parts of history, until now. What we’ve created is a one-of-a-kind experience that takes our viewers 1,400 years back to pre-Islamic Mecca, before Prophet Muhammad’s first revelation. Our revolutionary project “Mecca: A Journey Through Time” is a seven-minute immersive experience that explores the ins and outs of the world’s greatest hub, then and now. Equipped with crisp 8k Resolution picture and a sensory stimuli in our adventure ride (motion, scent, and sound), we’ve created a way for the curious to engage with an era in a way that truly excites. Undoubtedly, it is a must see for all with an affinity for historical exploration.  Our future is just as bright, with many additional title adventures in the works.",

We believe the potential market is huge and EPR is positioned to capture a very significant share of the rapid market growth following Food and Drug Administration (FDA) final approval of ongoing Emergency Preservation and Resuscitation (EPR) clinical trials. EPR can be used to induce rapid profound hypothermia, a state in which no oxygen delivery is required for 3+ hours, buying life-saving time for transport to a hospital followed by immediate surgical repairs and medical interventions. We believe EPR is the next revolutionary resuscitation step in saving the lives of loved ones too precious to be lost. EPR is in the pre-revenue stage of development and the Company's products are not available to the general public.",

  "description": "BrainScanology, Inc. is a tech startup developing a revolutionary shape analysis software that does not need to  measure area or volume! In 2018, Dr. Dave Nguyen, Ph.D. -a computational biologist from Berkeley- invented an algorithm to measure the complex shape of colon polyps. He named it Linear Compressed Polar Coordinate (LCPC) transformation. Years before that, in 2013, Dr. Nguyen lived a shocking personal event: one of his closest friends took his own life because of bipolar disorder. He promised that he would do something about bipolar disorder one day. With the creation of the LCPC Transform method, Dr. Nguyen realized exactly what his promise would look like: BrainScanology.",

However, the end-user experience is lackluster. Products tend to be full of fillers that don't actually help or enhance the hair or skin. The highlighted herbals on the labels are included at such micro amounts that they do not offer any real benefit. Also, few bath & body brands go beyond basic beauty and hygiene, or have products that support preventative health. Our bath and body products contain a much higher concentration of herbal ingredients than other brands that offer noticeable benefits like reducing inflammation, protecting the skin's natural biome, and moisture support. Customers share that they can see noticeable performance results after the first use.",

These communities have zero quality control on other platforms — leading to high flaking, low retention, hosts refusing to come back, and 1000s of users still left looking for community. On Clockout, we bring quality to informal interaction. First off, everyone is a professional and you can actually see what they do before meeting up with them so you don't feel like you're in a group chat with a bunch of strangers. Second, we have a dual-rating system. Not only are all clubs and events rated — all users receive an attendance score for free meetups to mitigate flaking and social anxiety. 90% of RSVPs show up and 80% of hosts come back to host more.\n\n",

  "description": "AlgenAir was co-founded by Dan Fucich, PhD and Kelsey Abernathy, PhD while finishing their doctoral research in marine biotechnology. They wanted to apply the incredible potential of algae to improve indoor air quality. The aerium was created to reduce carbon dioxide and increase oxygen indoors. It works synergistically with plants by recycling the algae as an all natural organic fertilizer. The aerium makes it easy for anyone to grow spirulina from plant enthusiasts to those without a green thumb and brings the photosynthetic power of 25 house plants to any room in your home.",

It’s very much a priority for parents to buy kids’ items that they can get more use out of, are good for the #environment, and make them feel good about their choices. At Markid, we understand that need, and are committed to creating a sustainable solution for parents’ shopping needs and building a community that takes pride in being part of the change. We’re on a mission to extend the life of every kid's product on the planet, by making it easy and accessible for parents to buy and sell on the platform. We’re uniquely positioned in this space with our focus on bringing purpose-aligned brands and parents together to achieve their vision of circularity. Passing on a greener world to our kids, will require an army of doers and innovators.

  "description": "This App Saves Lives, or TASL is a mobile app that partners with well known brands to provide meaningful rewards to drivers who choose not to engage in phone-based distracted driving, a habit resulting in 1.5 million accidents, 500,000 injuries, and 4,000 deaths every single year. Some of our brand partners to date include Urban Outfitters, Shake Shack, MistoBox, and KidPik, to name a few. After downloading the TASL app, drivers earn rewards points for time spent driving undistracted. Points are redeemable for rewards from our brand partners both online and in-store. Our mission is to improve public safety and put a serious dent in this dangerous habit by rewarding drivers who willingly choose not to use their phones while driving. Ten people die every single day from distracted driving. And as far as we’re concerned, that’s ten people too many. By rewarding drivers who choose not to drive distracted, we’re making the 1.5 million accidents, 500,000 injuries and 4,000 deaths a thing of the past. Together, we can put a dent in distracted driving.",

Every Saturday, nearly 1,000 people in the city of Phoenix come out to buy Proof Bread at one of 3 busy market locations we have been attending every week. When we built our Downtown Mesa bakery, we did so in a way that we could reach these customers all week long. Now we are building 2 new retail locations. One will be a tiny store in the heart of Downtown Phoenix where we will deliver fresh bread and pastries daily. The other is a warehouse and a satellite bakery in North Phoenix on the 51 near Shea. This one will be a combination bakery/Main Street Harvest location all under 1 roof where we will mill and store flour, as well as bake off Mesa-produced breads daily.",

We’re glad you’re here and appreciate your support through this process and we will keep you up to date as the state’s processes unfold.  \n\nWe’re striving to be cannabis cultivators (growers). The way New York has set it up- you can either be a cultivator OR open a dispensary. They do offer a Micro Business license for small scale full integration, but we will be applying for the 10,000 sq. ft. cultivation license. We will wholesale our products to a dispensary near you when the time comes. We currently are leasing and building out the first 5,000 sq. ft. in a building in Jamestown.  \n\n",
