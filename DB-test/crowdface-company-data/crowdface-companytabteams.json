After a brief span in biotech, he shifted into the hospitality business where he went back to his family roots. In 2005, Denny sought to start a restaurant in Rockford, Illinois and partnered with Andy Roiniotis. Driven by the success of the first restaurant, he launched three more restaurants and other businesses in the area over the next several years with his partner. His primary focus was back-of-house, menu design, inventory, cost control, and purchasing. The two decided to venture into the spirit world in 2017 and have formulated an award-winning, one-of-a-kind, sugarcane vodka. In 2019, Bella Rio was used to launch ROCK'N Vodka and Denny became a third partner. Denny played a critical role in the development of the ROCK'N recipe as he had been the one to suggest that ROCK'N be made from non-GMO products. Although Denny helps oversee all ROCK'N operations, he has been the inspiration behind all point of sale items and merchandise design.",

        "description": "Born to Greek immigrants, Andrew (Andy) grew up working every role in the hospitality industry through his family restaurants in Waukegan, Illinois. Andy credits his father, Gus, for his strong work ethic as he was taught every responsibility in the business, and now he instills those same lessons into his current businesses and into his children. He credits his mother, Youla, for his thinking out-of-the-box mentality and not being afraid to take chances. This lead Andy to Hollywood, where he created Four Play, a reality show. Swimming with the sharks in Hollywood, Andy learned and credits his business strategies and negotiation skills that are still used today. In 2005, he moved to Rockford, Illinois to start a new restaurant with his partner Denny Trakas. Not settling for the success of one business, Andy and his partners turned one location into a group by launching three more restaurants and other businesses. In 2015, Andy and his wife Isabelle started Bella Rio Consulting, which oversaw branding/consulting and community relations for their enterprises. In over thirteen years, they grew the companies to over 200 employees throughout seven businesses. Andy and his partners wanted to ensure that they always gave back to the community. They have since raised upwards of $500,000 for various charities in the last decade and have invested over $5,000,000 in Illinois by identifying opportunities and activating a blended network to drive success thus resulting in a stronger local economy. Andy became a community leader and sought to share his knowledge with others everywhere, including local municipalities and nonprofit organizations. In 2019, a dream was turned into a reality as Bella Rio became the parent company of ROCK'N Vodka, the now award-winning, sugarcane spirit. Andy's hard work and philithrophy allowed him the opportunity to invest in one of the most iconic brands in the world, Hard Rock Casino. There, Andy kept crossing paths with Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick and later introduced him to ROCK'N Vodka, where Rick became a partner. ",

Rick was born into a musical family, but he strayed from his opera singing parents to pursue a Rock & Roll career. He grew up learning to play different instruments in his family's music shop in Rockford, Illinois. Cheap Trick was born in 1973 with Bun E. Carlos, with his fellow band members joining sooner on. He's been creating music and touring since, and also created the famous five-neck guitar, as seen in his profile image and in ROCK'N Vodka logos. Rick has made numerous appearances on film and television, with multiple songs in different soundtracks. Performances on stages across the globe, music played on radio and streaming services everyday, and the band becoming a household name, it was no surprise that Cheap Trick was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. Rick became an investor in the new Hard Rock Rockford Casino as it was a major development in his hometown, and as Hard Rock is known to do, the company displayed this rockstar's memorabilia as the grand showcase. Through Hard Rock, Rick met Andy and was introduced to ROCK'N Vodka. Rick Nielsen was officially announced as the brand ambassador for ROCK'N Vodka in 2020. He later became a third owner of the brand and has become the face of the company. He continues to promote ROCK'N as he tours around the world, and regularly participates in marketing the brand by making appearances in-person, on social media, in radio, and more.",

For this company, Mr. Spear did all product research, wrote all sales copy, created and managed the back-end data management and order fulfillment system, did regulatory compliance for product labelling, and managed the fulfillment center in Boulder, CO. Following the sale of that company, Mr. Spear traveled around the world, ending his two-year trip in the fall of 2006 in Oaxaca, Mexico, where he had his first experience with traditional mezcal. ",

After 7 years working in various restaurant concepts for Yum Brands (such A&W, KFC, Long John Silvers, and Pizzahut), he left the company to finish college. After declining a full ride scholarship to law school, he instead pursued a real estate career and built experience in both residential and commercial real estate as well as property management. In 2019, after 12 years in real estate, he decided his passion was back in restaurants. After years of solo travel around the world in between real estate deals, Kyle realized that Las Vegas was sorely lacking in quality coffee concepts. He dreamed of a coffee concept that would evoke the warmth and heart of a Parisian cafe, the upscale sophisticatin of an Los Angeles restaurant, and an environment specifically geared towards adults; specifically professionals.
